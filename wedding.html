                           <h6 style="text-decoration:underline" > How I met Oluwadurotimi</h6>
                          <P> “Time & chance happens to them all” Ecclesiastes 9:11 define how I & Rotimi met.
<br>
We met at the right time & I gave him the chance at the right time as well...
<br>
I remember him leaving me messages via Facebook chat and I would mostly ignore his messages or give one word answers.
<br>
But he didn't stop... And he never got irritated or rude; that's what attracted me to the young man I was ignoring then... The man that would now become my husband... The man I have always dreamed of and imagined; my Knight in shiny armour.
<br>
I finally got talking with Rotimi and soon discovered he was different from my many Facebook admirers and trolls.
<br>
He is caring & God fearing... I remember how he helped me trace my steps back to God in more than an hour long (seemingly endless) phone call... I remember how he made me promise to re-dedicate my life to God without thinking or procrastinating as tomorrow may be too late...
<br>
Even his first gift to me were two devotionals  (Open Heavens & Daily Guide) & a guitar that constantly reminds me of how close I was to God and encourages me to be even closer now...
<br>
My first date with him was cancelled as I had to baby sit my nephew & niece... Later found out that he came all the way and I just didn't turn up *coversface & he sounded so cool about it; like he didn't go through any stress to see me that day only for me to cancel!
<br>
I thank God for his patience as I might have discouraged my soul mate from seeing me again if he wasn't understanding or patient; especially considering the fact that he is not mostly based in Nigeria.
<br>
We eventually met physically on the 31st of December, 2015 and to be honest; I knew he fell in love instantly (LOL)... Yes, my petite self got him smitten... I saw it in his eyes and noticed he nearly forgot what to do next as soon as he saw me :D We could have stood outside throughout if I didn't ask where we were going (LOL) ...But he was using his big stature & swag to hide his butterflies (HAHA!)
I won't lie; I liked his good looks and dress sense at first sight... We talked a lot & he insisted on dropping me off at home though I did my best to resist. When we were close to my house, I saw my dad's car coming out of our compound afar off & told him to park so no one would see us but he was determined to say hi briefly before leaving as he felt my dad would still see me get out of his car and he might consider it rude that I would get out of his car & the man dropping me off would not have the courtesy to do so in a responsible manner. So, he met my parents when I got home & I wasn't exactly comfortable with it... Little did I know his insistence was all in God's plan
<br>
I later fell in love with Oluwadurotimi mi just few days before he returned to his base... This was a very difficult period for me as I was doing shakara when he was around & fell in love hours to his return. I wondered if our relationship would work considering the distance...
<br>
Loving Oluwadurotimi has taught me that distance has got nothing on true love & that what is meant to be will be.
<br>
God bless the day I met you Rotimi

                            <p>Rotimi is a very caring and honest man... He loves to help people and definitely loves advising them even when they don't want to hear it (LOL)
<br>
He is God fearing & isn't afraid to preach the gospel... He has such a huge heart & knows how to make everyone around him (old or young) go "Awww"
<br>
Rotimi is my first aid consultant too. I guess he picked up the paramedic knowledge from his elder brother who is a doctor... He must not know I have a cough or sneezed; he will jump in to recommend a thousand & one ways to get cured (LOL)
<br>
Rotimi is also very funny & full of surprises... I am not used to getting surprised & I am the kind of lady that wants to know everything & I love to be involved, so you can imagine how that plays out & how I ruin his surprises sometimes. I love you & your surprises baby especially when I ruin it :D
<br>
Rotimi is Nike's man... Created for Nike too (HAHA!)</p>

                          <P> 
I always thought I would at least have a clue as to when I would be asked the big question... I didn't! 
<br>
I was aware of his arrival to Nigeria on the 13th of April, 2016. I had an exam on that day and days after that; I had work and I figured since I was already permitted to write exams, it won't be expected to ask for a day off to see baby on his arrival again. So, we agreed to see on the weekend on the week he arrives.
<br>
I went to exam in a rush as I barely slept; just threw on anything I could find to wear. My car was reared a day before and I left it to be fixed so I had to use public transportation...
Got home tired, sweaty & scruffy & noticed mum beaming with smiles and then I walked towards the dining area and noticed my sister raising her iPad in a picture/video like mode & the first question I asked was "Is Rotimi here?"
<br>
Boom! Out he came from the kitchen... I was so happy to see him of course & I could imagine that he came straight from the airport (probably didn't go home first)... I thought that was the end of d surprise.
<br>
I turned to see him on his knee with a small and cute red rose box that had a beautiful diamond ring in it... & he popped the question...
Of course, I said yes! I mean... He came all the way to ask me to marry him & planned it as a surprise too... Plus I am crazy about this man...
<br>
That wasn't the only surprise that day but that was the main surprise!
<br>
I love you so much Oluwadurotimi Daniel Bakare & I remain grateful for your unconditional love to me! God bless you greatly my heartbeat

                            <p>I would have made the greatest mistake of my life if I had tried to change every event I passed through before getting to this stage of my life. I put God first at every level in my life and I am proud today to say that the Grace of God has been sufficient and has brought me this far. I am a living testimony of God’s goodness. 
Taiwo Adenike Juliana was my last answered prayer point before the end of year 2015. A miracle that came into my life at the appointed time of God.  I have never been satisfied with any lady in my life until I met Adenike mi. <br>
Actually, my first date with Adenike was as if we both had known each other for years, but funny enough, that was my first time of meeting her one-on-one. 
Everyone asking me how I really met Adenike, and I was like…..Ecclesiastes 3:1-8
To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:
Back to the question……FACEBOOK!!!!<br>
At a point in my life, I had to shut down my Facebook account for few weeks because of unproductive distraction. Trust me guys, Facebook can be a very strong addiction that is difficult to get rid of without praying and fasting about it. Anyways, few weeks after I reconnected back to my Facebook account, I already had lot of friend requests and few unknown friends suggested to me on Facebook. 
Funny enough, other suggested friends came in group, but a few days later, I got only one friend suggested to me by Facebook, but whom was actually God’s sent. I knew from that very moment that she was the one and didn’t think twice before I added her as my friend on Facebook. I was glad when she accepted my friend request. I took courage and left her messages on Facebook chat after I went through her profile.
 We planned to have a date but she eventually didn't turn up as agreed. I called her to find out why she missed the date, and she had to baby sit her sister's set of twin babies. She actually sent me some photos of her baby sitting. 
Well, I didn't believe her, because anyone could get an old picture of baby sitting and send in justification. 
<br>
However, I began to love her more from that moment because I actually a love twins and babies in general. To be honest, I actually didn't plan to meet her any longer because I only had little time to spend in Nigeria before I returned back to my primary assignment but she gave me another date to make up for her disappointment. This time I had to weigh my options properly because it was a crossover night i.e. an eve night to 2016, 31st December 2015 to be precise. Well, we met, and I met her parents and took my first selfie with her on that same day. That same day, I knew Adenike was my wife because I prayed immediately I got back home and I felt the presence of God with me. Our date was all a divine arrangement by God to answer my last prayer request for the year 2015 before it came to an end. 
<br>
So after crossing over to 2016, I started to follow up on her because I had only few days to travel back to my primary assignment. I asked her to be my girl friend but she didn't give me a an assured response, so I asked her for another date but this time around, I suggested to meet her at her parents’ house but she insisted we meet at my place instead. I wasn't happy because I promised myself that the next time I would invite a lady to my apartment, she must be my fiancée or wife. So with this thought in me, I was very worried and uncomfortable around her when she arrived. 
<br>
On the other hand, I was also happy because I had to specially cook for her before her arrival and my sister was very supportive in the kitchen as well. Lo and behold, Adenike arrived at my house and after spending some time with my family without mentioning anything about my request; I didn't bother to ask her in order not to ruin her visitation because I didn't know what was running through her mind. But while on my way to drop her at the car park, I popped the same question and she was like, she actually came to my house to say YES. 
Wow! ...I was so happy, I felt peace immediately because this was just a day to my trip leaving Nigeria. We got to the car park and I had to give her a goodbye kiss which was my first kiss with Adenike mi. So I had two memories take along with me to Qatar which were; our 1st selfie and our 1st kiss. What a marvellous package from God. 
<br>
God helped me meet Adenike on the last day in 2015;  this same God gave me Adenike as my fiancee on my last day of stay in Nigeria before resuming my new job at Qatar. Glory be to the God in the highest!
<br>
 Still like a dream but it's actually reality. Anyone could have had Adenike mi as a wife but God purposely kept her for me. I love you sweetie. I am ready to share my life with you forever baby. Your presence in my life broke all protocols... I believe God makes everything beautiful in his own time.
<br>
I cover our marital life with the Blood of Jesus Christ and I pray that anyone that tries to separate us shall be cut off by the power of God.
<br>
To God be the Glory!!!

                            <p>
I have never met a lady so full of enthusiasm like Taiwo Adenike. She is hard working and doesn't joke with her career. The thought of her makes me sit up and focus more at my work because of the great responsibilities that lie ahead of me. I believe she's a type of woman every man would pray to have as a wife. No woman is perfect, however, In spite of her imperfection, my love for her gets stronger daily. 
<br>
So far so good, Taiwo Adenike makes me understand how patient a man must be to live with a woman. Adenikemi will forever be my best friend till Jesus comes.
<br>

                            <h6 style="text-decoration:underline">The Proposal</h6>
                            <p>Feeling so perplexed in Qatar before embarking on my trip to Nigeria in order to Surprise my Fiancee with a proposal ring. I thought of the best strategies but nothing actually was satisfactory to me. I've seen many people propose at the airport, on the street, etc... But I just wanted my strategy to be unique. So I took my time, I prayed and planned properly. 
<br>
I made up my mind to surprise Adenikemi at her parents’ house; in the presence of those that really matter to her and have been with her up till this point of her life. So I called my friend, Deji to stylishly find out about her plans at the week of my arrival to Nigeria. As the Lord may have it, she had an examination on the same day I arrived to Nigeria. However, before that time, I had already contacted and discussed my plans with her elder sister, Iya-ibeji. Glory be to God, I arrived safely to the country, thereafter I visited Adenike's house. 
<br>
I met her parents and Iya-ibeji at home and we made the final plan to surprise Adenike before she returned from her examination centre. A big shout out to my mother in-law for her great contribution toward the surprise package. What a beautiful day I officially proposed to my wife, Adenikemi in the presence of her family members. I wasn't terrified but I nearly missed the plan at her arrival because of the great joy that was in me. I finally came out from the kitchen and proposed to my lovely wife, Adenike mi, Olori mi, my soul mate from God. I am grateful to God and I can proudly say that I have a loving wife that will be the mother of my children and with whom I will spend the rest of my life.
